1. What is Interface in Java?
    An interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.
    Its class responsibility to implement the methods declared in the Interface
    When class agreed to implement the interface, they must need to provide implementation/bodies to all the defined methods in Interface
    In simple terms, Interface enforces the Contract to class to follow.

2. WebDriver is an Interface which provides set of Browser Automation methods with empty bodies(Abstract Methods)
    Classes like ChromeDriver, FireFoxDriver, EdgeDriver, SafariDriver and Provide their own implementation to the WebDriver methods.

3. We need to create the object of the class to access the methods
- ChromeDriver is a class and which allows you to access all the methods that implemented to automate Chrome browser
    getTitle(), getUrl(), getText(), close(), quite() all these different methods are available ChromeDriver class to automate.
- We need to create the object of the clas to access the mthords present in the class.
    ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    driver object here has access to all the methods of ChromeDriver

    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    driver object here has access to the methods of ChromeDriver which are defined in WebDriver interface.
